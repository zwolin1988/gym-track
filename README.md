## About the Project

Gym Track is a web application designed to help fitness enthusiasts systematically track their workout progress. The app enables users to:

- **Create personalized workout plans** with exercises from a curated database
- **Log workouts in real-time** with detailed parameters (sets, reps, weight)
- **Track progress automatically** with calculated statistics and metrics
- **Visualize improvements** through charts and workout history
- **Stay organized** with a clean, mobile-friendly interface

### Key Features

‚úÖ **Authentication & Security** - Secure user registration and login with Row Level Security (RLS)
‚úÖ **Exercise Database** - 50+ predefined exercises across 5-10 muscle categories
‚úÖ **Workout Plans** - Full CRUD operations for creating and managing training plans
‚úÖ **Smart Workout Logger** - Real-time tracking with parameter modifications during workouts
‚úÖ **Automatic Statistics** - Calculate total volume, duration, max weight, and more
‚úÖ **Progress Visualization** - Charts showing training volume over time
‚úÖ **Responsive Design** - Optimized for both mobile and desktop use

### Target Audience

- Regular gym-goers tracking their training progress
- Fitness enthusiasts seeking systematic workout logging
- Beginners to intermediate users looking for simple, effective tracking tools

- **DigitalOcean** - Application hosting via Docker containers
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **ESLint & Prettier** - Code linting and formatting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v22.14.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Supabase Account** (for backend services)

If you use `nvm` (Node Version Manager):

```bash
nvm use
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gym-track.git
cd gym-track
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Fill in your environment variables in `.env`:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

3. Set up your Supabase project:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key to `.env`
   - Run database migrations (if available)

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Authentication Architecture

Gym Track uses **Supabase Auth** as the primary authentication system with the following architecture:

### User Management
- **Registration & Login**: All user accounts are created and managed through Supabase Auth
- **Session Management**: Supabase handles session tokens, refresh tokens, and authentication state
- **User Identity**: Each user receives a unique `user_id` from Supabase Auth (`auth.uid()`)

### Data Association
- **Automatic Linking**: All workout plans, workouts, and user data are automatically linked to the authenticated user
- **User Context**: In Astro routes, access the authenticated user via `context.locals.user`
- **Authenticated Client**: Use `context.locals.supabase` for database operations (pre-configured with user session)

### Security Model
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Every database table uses RLS policies
- **Policy Example**: `workout_plans` table policy: `user_id = auth.uid()`
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only query, insert, update, or delete their own records
- **No Manual user_id Management**: The application never manually sets `user_id` - it's always derived from Supabase Auth

### Protected Routes
- Middleware checks authentication status
- Unauthenticated users are redirected to login
- API endpoints validate session tokens

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server on port 3000 |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint to check code quality |
| `npm run lint:fix` | Automatically fix ESLint issues |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Prettier |

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses **Husky** and **lint-staged** to automatically run quality checks before commits:

- ESLint auto-fix for `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.astro` files
- Prettier formatting for `.json`, `.css`, `.md` files
