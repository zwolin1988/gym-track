### Guidelines for Astro

- Leverage View Transitions API for smooth page transitions (use ClientRouter)
- Use content collections with type safety for blog posts, documentation, etc.
- Leverage Server Endpoints for API routes
- Use POST, GET  - uppercase format for endpoint handlers
- Use `export const prerender = false` for API routes
- Use zod for input validation in API routes
- Extract logic into services in `src/lib/services`
- Implement middleware for request/response modification
- Use image optimization with the Astro Image integration
- Implement hybrid rendering with server-side rendering where needed
- Use Astro.cookies for server-side cookie management
- Leverage import.meta.env for environment variables
